# Furious Tracker

## Overview
Furious Tracker is a real-time object tracking system that leverages advanced computer vision and deep learning techniques to track objects in video streams with high accuracy. It provides real-time visualization of tracked objects using bounding boxes and unique IDs.

**Objectives:**

•	Develop a system to track objects in real-time video streams.

•	Visualize tracked objects with bounding boxes and IDs.

**Technology Sketch:**

•	Programming Language: Python

•	Computer Vision Libraries: OpenCV

•	Tracking Algorithms: DeepSORT

•	Machine Learning Frameworks: PyTorch (for custom models)

•	Visualization Tools: OpenCV

•	Key Frameworks: Streamlit (for deployment)

**Proposed Outcomes:**
1.	AI Domain Knowledge:
o	Object detection and tracking techniques.

2.	Application mains:
   
o	Surveillance and security systems.

o	Autonomous vehicles and robotics.

o	Sports analytics and activity tracking.

4.	Resume Values:
o	Experience with real-time object tracking algorithms.

o	Practical skills for videoprocessors and analysis.

o	Deployment of a real-world tracking application.

o	Industry-relevant tools like OpenCV and deep learning frameworks.
